"Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another" - Plato

We're just a couple fans of astronomy and wanted to pay homage

It gets input from a user, and we take that input into our machine learning algorithms and tell the user whether or not such a planet is earth like based on our data models.

Essentially this was our first time using all technologies listed except for python. Apparently, the Amazon Web Service is incapable of finding our python script that runs the machine learning algorithms.

For a couple of guys who only know C++ and Python, we did our best.

We learned that there's so much more to learn. Nevertheless, this was a great first hackathon!
